## How awesome is the ecosystem?

[Erldocs](http://erldocs.com/) lists several libraries from asn1 to wxWidgets. They definitely tend towards networking and telecommunications.

### Does the language have a package manager?

Inofficially, [Hex](https://hex.pm/).

### Can I use modules from other languages?

It is possible to write erlang interfaces in C using [`erl_interface`](http://no-fucking-idea.com/blog/2013/02/05/building-ffi-extensions-in-erlang/).

There appears to have been an effort 2006--2008 for a [C FFI](http://muvara.org/crs4/erlang/ffi/), patches included.

### Are there lots of packages?

## How good are the official docs?

There are definitely plenty.

Probably, after twenty years? I'm not sure I'm ready to tell...

## How standardised is the language?

There's only one implementation.

There is a "Core Initiative" by the U. of U. and Ericsson, with a (draft?) core language spec from 2004 [here](https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/cerl/doc/core_erlang-1.0.3.pdf).
